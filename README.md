# McDonaldPriceInToronto
This project examines pricing variations among selected products across different McDonald's chains in Toronto. By analyzing factors such as location proximity and consumer preferences, we aim to uncover the drivers behind these pricing strategies. Our study focuses on the correlation between downtown proximity and higher product prices, as well as consumer purchasing patterns. Our research contains Clustering and PCA(Principal Component Analysis) to investigate the fast-food chain pattern.![image](https://github.com/HuanCheHsu/McDonaldPriceInToronto/assets/160444147/b4395937-dd31-433c-9fa3-0b2648e5d317)

1.	First thesis 

The objective of this thesis is to analyse and provide evidence to support the notion that when a McDonald's chain is located closer to or within the downtown area, the prices of its products tend to be higher compared to other areas.
	
2.	Second thesis

By examining data on various combinations of food, we can gain valuable insights into consumer purchasing patterns, enabling us to delve deeper into analyzing consumer preferences.
